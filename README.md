		- members; 	people who work directly under the admin. team members and employees who need to be managed by the admin and the website.
		- clients; 		admin's and members' clients. these are the people who purchase services and goods from OUR client, the admin.

		- CRUD; 		create edit update delete; short form for a 4 set of functionality. e.g. registre a user = create. change user password = update / edit, delete is self explanatory.
